          <p>
            I am a professional software engineer with more than 20 years of
            experience across a wide range of industries and technologies,
            focusing on full-stack web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have helped many companies building high quality scalable
            software and fulfilled different roles such as a CTO, a consultant, a
            team leader, and a lead programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am constantly learning new technologies and familiarizing myself with
            the newest developments in my area of expertise to keep my knowledge
            up to date.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not coding, I’m most probably spending quality time with my
            family and friends, or learning about a new amazing technology.

            range of calories, number of ingredients, and some diet and health
            issues. The app will display up to 40 related recipes for each meal

            only knows how to program, but also manage commercialization of a
            product. He has made major contributions to developing and
            commercializing our new G6GFINDR System at https://g6gfindr.com. I

            Shlomi is an exceptional software developer, highly trustable and
            creative. He has developed very useful cloud based software to
            help labs like ours to store, manage and share the overwhelming
            amount of data we are generating as a result of conducting lab
            research. He has designed and developed the system by himself from
            scratch and he was always open for new ideas and very fast in
            bringing these ideas to live via the software. I was amazed to see
            how passionate he is about what he is doing and his honest
            willingness to create an outstanding product that will make a real
            impact in improving efficiency and productivity in the lab. I had
            the opportunity to work with Shlomi for many months during the
            development of the system, when he was in constant contact with me
            and my team while asking for my advice to be able to build a
            product that will fit our needs. Subsequently, he installed the
            new tool in my lab at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center. I am extremely
            impressed with Shlomi and highly recommend his services as a
            software consultant.

            I had been given the great opportunity to test out the laboratory
            data management tool SciRoLab. In my opinion, this should be a
            staple in every research lab environment. With very minimal effort
            our lab has could incorporate a large majority of our data and
            provide meta data for all of it. On a near daily basis we have
            could quickly recall figures and experiments from months ago with
            a simple search on the program. In addition, this program being
            based out of a secure website, it has allowed us access our data
            from anywhere and efficiently communicate between lab members. The
            security features provide unique opportunities to provide
            hierarchies within the lab to grant or restrict access for
            potential rotating students, previous lab members, and
            collaborators. The price of this software is extremely reasonable
            and well worth the cost. The largest selling point to this whole
            program is the willingness of the developers to add new features
            when we request them. Very quickly and effectively our lab could
            tailor this program to our needs. The staff at Onca were more than
            accommodating and created quality changes very quickly.
